    <p class="govuk-body">DWP is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Some tables use horizontal scrolling. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow). This means that some users will not be able to view tables correctly when scaling content above 300%</li>
      <li>Some elements with a navigation role do not have unique labels. This may make it difficult for users to orient themselves and find the right content. This fails WCAG 2.4.1 success criterion (Page Titled)</li>
      <li>
      Some pages cannot be found through more than one type of navigation. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.5 (Multiple Ways)</li>
